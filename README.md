# JLCPCB-Christmas-Competition-PCB
This is my submission to the 2020 JLCPCB Christmas Competition. I arranged several presents into a pile which can be put in front of other submissions resembling a christmas tree, but still act as its own PCB. It uses an ATMEGA328P to power 8 sections of 5 LEDs, two per present, and they can be any color wanted, and blink whenever programmed. I am happy to be using https://JLCPCB.com with their partner https://EasyEDA.com for my PCB, and their services are really some of the best.
